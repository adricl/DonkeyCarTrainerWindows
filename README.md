# DonkeyCarTrainerWindows
This script watches a directory where .zip files are placed, unzips them and run the donkey car training over them. 
It will created the augmented version as well as the normal version.

Each zip file should be just one tub.


We use 7z as its much faster than windows zip extractor and with so many files it can take too long.

Please excuse my powershell as its my first large script.
